## FlyoutPage Navigation

This demo shows you how you can use **FlyoutPage** to navigate around an application. It shows you both top level and drill-down details page navigation without using **Shell**.

On initial launch, the FlyoutPage's `Detail` property is set to an instance of a ContentPage for authentication.

After signing in, the `Detail` of the **FlyoutPage** is replaced with a **NavigationPage**. The lets the user navigate around the app using the menu on the left.

- That menu is actually a ContentPage hosted by the `FlyputPage.Flyout` property.
- The area on the right is a "RoutesPage" **ContentPage** hosted in a **NavigationPage** which is set to the `FlyoutPage.Detail`

Finally, because the `FlyoutPage.Detail` is a **NavigationPage**, we can 'drill-down' navigate from the RoutesPage to a "RouteDetailPage" while still technically being on the Routes page that was selected in the menu.
