## Signature Editor

This demo shows how to dynamically load signatures and swap between **edit-mode** with the `RadSignaturePad`, and **view-mode** with the Image of the saved signature.

> When the app launches, it first checks to see if a signature was already saved. If there was a previous signature, it will load that and start in view-mode. Otherwise, it will start in edit-mode.
